|Dear Neebyo Community,<br/><br/>As we close the chapter on another remarkable year, I am thrilled to share the incredible strides we've made together. This year was transformative for Neebyo as we took a bold step to revise [our mission, vision, and strategy](https://www.neebyo.org/about/). This process allowed us to refocus our efforts, define clear goals, and most importantly, achieve meaningful impact.<br/><br/>Our collective dedication and hard work have not only redefined our purpose but also strengthened our commitment to making a difference. Along this journey, we forged valuable long-term partnerships and established mentorship programs that have enriched our community and enhanced our reach.<br/><br/>As we celebrate these achievements, it's crucial to recognize that this is just the beginning. The path ahead is filled with boundless potential, and we are eager to embrace the challenges and opportunities that the future holds. Your passion, resilience, and support have been the driving force behind our success, and I am confident that together, we will continue to create positive change in the lives of those we serve. <br/><br/>Thank you for your unwavering dedication to our cause. The best is yet to come, and we look forward to the incredible journey ahead. <br/><br/>Wishing you a joyful holiday season and a prosperous New Year! <br/><br/>Warm regards, <br/>Jeanne d’Arc Uwatowenimana|![Samburu Girls Foundation](/img/jeanne-profile.jpeg)|
