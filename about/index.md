A Canadian Not-for-profit initiative founded by [Jeanne d'Arc Uwatowenimana](https://jeannedarc.io/) to raise digital awareness among disadvantaged communities in rural areas of Africa. We raise money for local communities and partner with them to leverage coding & entrepreneurship skills and empower youth to create open-source web/mobile applications that solve small community problems.
